    "### 5.7: News Classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop aims to explore Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures for text-based tasks. We will learn how to preprocess text data (through tokenisation and word embedding), apply RNNs to a news classification problem, and use LSTMs for text generation tasks such as poetry creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Tokenization and Embedding:** Learn how to transform raw text into a suitable input format (tokens) and represent words or tokens as dense vector embeddings for neural network processing.\n",
    "2. **RNN-Based Classification:** The AG News dataset exemplifies applying a simple RNN model to a text classification task.\n",
    "3. **LSTM for Text Generation:** Gain hands-on experience building an LSTM model to generate text using the Adele.txt poetry dataset as a case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Introduction to Text Modelling for Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with textual data, we must convert language into numerical representations that neural networks can process. This involves two key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenisation:** Splitting the text into smaller units, usually words (or sometimes sub-words or characters).\n",
    "2. **Word Embedding:** Mapping each token to a continuous vector space (e.g., via word2vec or Glove-like embeddings) so semantically similar tokens have similar vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These representations capture syntactic and semantic relationships, enabling models to learn patterns across sequences of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "`Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)` are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that propagates information from one time step to the next. Traditional RNNs, however, often struggle with long-term dependencies due to vanishing or exploding gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Long-short-term memory (LSTM)` networks address these issues by introducing a memory cell and gating mechanisms (input, output, and forget gates) that regulate how information flows through the network. This allows the model to maintain longer-range dependencies, making it especially effective for language modelling and text generation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AG News Classification:**\n",
    "    - Use tokenized AG News articles and feed them into an RNN architecture for topic classification.\n",
    "    - The model learns to identify news categories (e.g., World, Business, Sports) by capturing patterns in word usage.\n",
    "2. **LSTM for Poetry Generation:**\n",
    "    - Train an LSTM on the Adele.txt dataset (or any poetry corpus) to learn linguistic styles and generate new verses.\n",
    "    - By sampling from the trained model, you can produce novel lines of text that mimic the style of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Student Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select a book dataset of your choice and preprocess the text for training.\n",
    "- Implement a bidirectional LSTM or GRU model using TensorFlow for text generation.\n",
    "- Train the model to learn the text style and structure, then generate new text samples.\n",
    "- Share your code, model configuration, training strategies, and generated samples in the collaborative coding discussion forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you explored how tokenisation, word embedding, and recurrent architectures (RNN, LSTM) form the backbone of many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. By implementing classification and text-generation tasks, you gain practical insights into how neural networks handle sequential data. These skills will be a solid foundation for more advanced NLP techniques, such as Transformer-based models and attention mechanisms. "
